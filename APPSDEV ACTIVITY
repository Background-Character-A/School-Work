Problem Statement
Title: Grocery Store Discount Calculator
You are tasked with creating a console application for a grocery store that calculates the total cost for a customer based on the items they purchase, applies applicable discounts, and provides the final amount. The application should include:
Control Structures:
Selection: To determine if a discount should be applied.
Looping: To process multiple items purchased by the customer.
Math Operations: To calculate the total cost, discount, and final amount.
Requirements:
The customer can purchase multiple items. For each item, the user should input the item name, quantity, and price per unit.
The application should calculate the total cost before any discounts.
If the total cost exceeds $100, apply a 10% discount.
If the total cost exceeds $200, apply a 15% discount instead of the 10%.
If the total cost exceeds $500, apply a 20% discount instead of the 15%.
Display the total cost before discount, the discount amount, and the final amount to be paid by the customer.
The user should be able to enter multiple items, and the application should prompt the user if they want to enter another item or finish.
